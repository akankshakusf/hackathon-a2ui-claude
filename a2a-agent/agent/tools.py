"""
A2UI Agent tools.

This module is intentionally minimal - the A2UI agent generates UI declaratively
without needing external data sources. The agent creates forms, lists, cards, and
other UI components based purely on user requests.

Future tools could be added here for specific use cases like:
- Storing form submission data
- Fetching external data for dynamic lists
- Integration with external services

# No tools currently needed - A2UI generates UI from user descriptions
